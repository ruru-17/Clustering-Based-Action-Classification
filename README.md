# Clustering-Based Action Clips Classification  
This project was done for an assignment in the course MTL782 Data Mining, Spring Semester 2024-25 at IIT Delhi.

The objective of this project is to cluster the video dataset into 15 clusters, and then label new clips based on the cluster labeling done in training.

It has 2 parts: 
1) Non-Competitive
2) Competitve  

The Non-competitve parts had several restrictions regarding allowed models and feature engineering, whereas in the Competitive part we had more freedom. Refer to Problem_Statement.pdf for complete problem statement.  

See Code_NC.ipynb for code of Non-competitive part.

See Comp_C.ipynb for code of Competitive part.
